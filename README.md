**Find your disease website**

This website helps a user determine the disease or condition they might have based on the symptoms they have. 
A user selects the part of the body where they have the symptoms and then selects the symptoms they have from the drop down.
Based on their symptoms, the website tells them the disease they might have and provides a link for more information about that disease.
It also suggests some solutions to tackle the disease.
The website also has a feature that allows a user to search for hostpitals and displays the location on a map.
